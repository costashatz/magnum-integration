@subsection changelog-integration-2018-02-changes Changes and improvements

-   Extended math type conversion in @ref BulletIntegration, improved tests
    for @ref BulletIntegration::MotionState (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#22](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/22))
-   Fixed linker errors when using @ref BulletIntegration compiled as DLL on
    Windows
-   Various code modernization improvements (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#25](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/25))

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-02-buildsystem Build system

-   Continuous testing for Linux, macOS, Windows MSVC, Windows MinGW, Windows RT,
    iOS, Android and Emscripten on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mosra/magnum-integration)
    and [AppVeyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mosra/magnum-integration),
    with code coverage on [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/mosra/magnum-integration);
    replacing the unmaintained and outdated Jenkins configuration
-   Support for CMake subprojects. You can now clone Magnum Plugins into a
    subdirectory in your project and add it using @cmake add_subdirectory() @ce.
    The @cmake find_package() @ce command will then use the CMake subproject
    instead of looking for it in system-wide locations.
-   Reworked CMake buildsystem to use the new imported target workflow, see
    @ref cmake-integration for more information
-   CMake targets are now organized in folders for better development
    experience in IDEs such as Visual Studio or Xcode
-   Added a @ref building-integration-packages-brew "Homebrew package"
-   `MACOSX_RPATH` is now enabled by default on CMake 3.0+
-   `FindMagnumIntegration.cmake` now properly handles Bullet installations
    with both debug and release libraries (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#14](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/14))
-   Fixed static @ref BulletIntegration libraries being treated as dynamic (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#16](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/16))
-   Enabling only C++ in CMake @cmake project() @ce call, if possible, to speed
    up initial CMake run

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-02-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   Properly respecting the `BUILD_STATIC` CMake option when building and
    avoiding treatment of static libraries as dynamic on Windows
-   Various compilation fixes (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#23](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/23),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#24](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/24),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#27](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/27))

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-02-deprecated Deprecated APIs

    longer needed.
